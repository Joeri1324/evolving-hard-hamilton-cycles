# Evolving Hard Hamilton Cycle Problem Instances

This repositiory holds the source code for the experiment to evolve difficult instances for the Hamilton cycle problem using a tochastic hillclimber and the Plant propagation algorithm. It also provides the possibility to bind the instance to include a Hamilton cycle.
